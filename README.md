# VariedBodySizes

This mod will make the bodysize of pawns and animals a bit more varied. When a pawn spawns they will get a random change in their size. This is by default just a visual effect, but can be changed in the settings to affect gameplay as well.

Mod-settings 


-  Default size-range
-  Also modify the actual body-size value (affects gameplay)
-  Individual size variation per pawntype



Verified to work with https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=839005762]Humanoid Alien Races and some children-mods.
